                Harch Corp S.A. is a Moroccan multi-sector industrial conglomerate headquartered in Casablanca, Morocco. We operate across seven core verticals: AI data centers and intelligence infrastructure (1,798 GPU capacity), renewable energy generation and distribution (2GW+ Renewable Pipeline), cement and construction materials manufacturing, sovereign technology and cybersecurity services, strategic mining operations including phosphates and critical minerals, precision agriculture and vertical farming, and water infrastructure including desalination and treatment. Our supply chain spans multiple countries across Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, and includes raw material suppliers, equipment manufacturers, construction contractors, technology providers, logistics companies, and professional service firms. The diversity and scale of our operations present inherent modern slavery risks, particularly in labor-intensive sectors such as construction, mining, and agriculture, and in regions where regulatory frameworks may be less robust.
